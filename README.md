This repository is dedicated to my daily coding practice. Each day, I upload problems mainly focused on Maths based problems, and another that dives deeper into specific general problem-solving using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) topics. The goal is to build strong problem-solving skills and reinforce topic-wise understanding through consistent practice.
